        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        
        
        if(a>b ){
            
            System.out.println(a + " is greater");
        }
        else if(b>a){
            System.out.println(b +" is greater");
        }
        
        else {
            System.out.println("Both are equal");
