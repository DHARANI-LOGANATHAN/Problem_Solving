You are given three integers. Your task is to find and print the greatest number among them.
If two or more numbers are equal and greatest, print that number with a note:
There is a tie for the greatest number
Input Format

The first line contains an integer a
The second line contains an integer b
The third line contains an integer c

Output Format

If one number is strictly the greatest, print:
X is the greatest
If thereâ€™s a tie for the greatest, print:
There is a tie for the greatest number
Sample Input 0

10  
20  
30
Sample Output 0

30 is the greatest

 public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        int c=sc.nextInt();
        int max=a;
        if(max<b && c<b){
            max=b;
            System.out.println(max + " is the greatest");
        }
        else if(max<c && b<c){
            max=c;
            System.out.println(max + " is the greatest");
        }
        else if(a==b || a==c || b==c){
            System.out.println("There is a tie for the greatest number");
        }
